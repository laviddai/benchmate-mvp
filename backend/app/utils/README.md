# Utilities Directory

This directory contains utility modules and helper functions that support the operation of BenchMate-MVP. The utilities provide common functionality required across multiple parts of the backend, such as configuration loading, data conversion, authentication, logging, and other shared tasks.

## Directory Structure

- **benchsocial/**:  
  Contains utility functions that are specific to the social platform domain. These might include helpers for processing social data or interfacing with social-related endpoints.

- **benchtop/**:  
  Contains utility functions for the researcher tools, such as data processing and visualization utilities tailored for biology or other scientific modules.

- **Common Utilities:**  
  Utilities that are used across both domains (for example, `config_loader.py` which reads and parses YAML configuration files) are placed directly in this directory or within subfolders labeled as shared/common if needed.

## How It Works

- **Usage:**  
  These modules are imported into your endpoint code or other parts of the backend as needed to perform recurring tasks. For example, the `config_loader.py` in this directory loads YAML files from the configuration folder and makes them available as JSON objects to your API endpoints.

- **Extending Utilities:**  
  When adding new helper functions, please organize them in the appropriate subfolder (benchsocial, benchtop, or shared) to maintain clarity. Include inline documentation or comments that describe the functionâ€™s purpose, parameters, and return values.

- **Best Practices:**  
  Ensure that all utilities are thoroughly tested and documented. Consistency in naming conventions and code style is essential for long-term maintenance and scalability.

This folder is crucial for minimizing code duplication and centralizing common functionalities across the BenchMate-MVP backend.
