**Prompt for General BenchMate Project Context:**

"Hello! We're working on a project called BenchMate. It's a complex platform with two main components: BenchTop (an analytical workbench for scientists) and BenchMate Social (a collaborative social layer). Our immediate focus is on developing the MVP for BenchTop.

To get the full context, please familiarize yourself with the following key documents (imagine these are accessible to you, e.g., from a provided knowledge base or a recent project dump):

1.  **Project Vision & Overall Goals:** `docs/white_paper.md` (Version 0.3)
    *   *Pay attention to:* Sections 1 (Exec Summary), 2 (Introduction), 3 (The BenchMate Solution), and 6 (Key Differentiators).
2.  **Product Requirements (especially for BenchTop MVP):** `docs/prd.md` (Version 0.3)
    *   *Pay attention to:* Section 1 (Introduction & Vision), Section 3 (BenchTop MVP: Demonstrating a Generalizable Workflow - especially user stories and functional requirements), and Section 4 (Future Features).
3.  **System Architecture & Technical Stack:** `docs/architecture.md` (Version 0.2)
    *   *Pay attention to:* Section 3 (High-Level System Architecture), Section 4 (Detailed Component Interactions), Section 5 (Directory Structure), and Section 7 (Technology Choices Rationale).
4.  **Project Entry & Setup:** The root `README.md` (Version 0.3, as recently refined).

My role involves [briefly state your primary role, e.g., "leading the backend development and overall project strategy," or "focusing on implementing backend analysis modules and the supporting frontend interactions"].

The current primary task is [e.g., "to build out the barebones Next.js frontend for the bulk RNA-seq analysis workflow as detailed in PRD Section 3.3," or "to develop a new backend analysis module for PCA plots for bulk RNA-seq data"].

Please act as a Senior Full-Stack Developer and an expert in the technologies and principles outlined in my pre-configured system instructions (React, NextJS, Python, FastAPI, data analysis, etc.). I will provide specific tasks shortly. Confirm you have processed this context."
