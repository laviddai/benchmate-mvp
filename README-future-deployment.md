# Future Implementation Plan for Multi-Platform Deployment

This document outlines the planned approach to deploy BenchMate as a:

- **Web Application**
- **Desktop Application**
- **Mobile Application**

It also details future steps for dockerization and CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent deployment across environments.

---

## Overview

BenchMate is being designed as an integrated platform combining a scientific tool suite with a social layer. Our goal is to deliver the platform in three primary modes:

1. **Web App:** The primary experience via a React frontend that communicates with a FastAPI-based backend.
2. **Desktop App:** A downloadable desktop program (e.g., using Electron or Tauri) that wraps the web app, providing local performance and offline capabilities.
3. **Mobile App:** A mobile-friendly version either through a Progressive Web App (PWA) or a native app built with React Native.

Dockerization and CI/CD pipelines will also be implemented to ensure smooth deployments and consistency across these delivery channels.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Web Application

**Backend (API):**
- **Structure:**  
  - Continue using the modular backend structure under `backend/app/`.
  - Ensure API endpoints are documented (consider using OpenAPI/Swagger for the FastAPI server).
- **Dockerization:**  
  - Create a `Dockerfile` in the `backend/` folder.
  - Example content for the backend Dockerfile:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.9-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY backend/requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    COPY backend/ .
    CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
    ```
- **When to Implement:**  
  - Early in the MVP phase. The web app is the primary experience; get the REST API up and running first.

**Frontend (React):**
- **Structure:**  
  - Set up the React project in the `frontend/` directory.
  - Organize components (e.g., TooltipGuide, FileUploader) in a modular folder structure.
- **API Communication:**  
  - Use Axios or fetch to connect with the backend endpoints.
  - Ensure default configurations (converted from YAML to JSON) are fetched properly.
- **Dockerization:**  
  - Create a separate `Dockerfile` in the `frontend/` folder.
  - Example content for the frontend Dockerfile:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:14-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY frontend/package.json .
    RUN npm install
    COPY frontend/ .
    RUN npm run build
    CMD ["npx", "serve", "build"]
    ```
- **When to Implement:**  
  - Parallel with backend development. Begin integration testing as soon as the initial API endpoints are available.

### Phase 2: Desktop Application

**Desktop Packaging with Electron/Tauri:**
- **Approach:**  
  - Wrap the React web app using Electron (or Tauri for a lighter alternative).
  - Create a new directory (e.g., `desktop/`) where the Electron main process and configuration files reside.
- **Folder Structure:**  
  - Example structure:
    ```
    desktop/
      ├── main.js        // Electron entry point
      ├── package.json   // Desktop app configuration
      └── preload.js     // (if needed) preload scripts for secure API access
    ```
- **Integration:**  
  - Point Electron to load the locally served React build (or package with backend API locally if offline usage is required).
- **Dockerization/Packaging:**  
  - Use tools like Electron Builder to compile a standalone executable for the target OS.
- **When to Implement:**  
  - Once the web app MVP is stable, start integrating the desktop version.
  - Desktop packaging can follow after the web app core functionality is proven.

### Phase 3: Mobile Application

**Mobile via PWA or React Native:**
- **Option 1: Progressive Web App (PWA)**
  - **Implementation:**  
    - Enhance your React app to support PWA features (e.g., service worker, manifest.json).
    - Optimize performance for mobile devices.
  - **Folder Changes:**  
    - Include a `manifest.json` and service worker configuration in the React project.
  - **When to Implement:**  
    - Once the web app is finalized, begin adding PWA capabilities.
  
- **Option 2: React Native**
  - **Implementation:**  
    - Set up a separate React Native project.
    - Share common logic and styles where possible (consider a monorepo setup).
  - **Folder Changes:**  
    - Create a new `mobile/` directory to house the React Native project.
  - **When to Implement:**  
    - Start after the core functionality (backend API and web frontend) is complete.

## Dockerization & CI/CD

**Docker Configuration:**
- At the root level, create the following files:
  - `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate multi-container setups for backend and frontend.
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      backend:
        build: ./backend
        ports:
          - "8000:8000"
      frontend:
        build: ./frontend
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
    ```
- Include Dockerfiles in the respective directories as detailed above.

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Configure your repository (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to automate building, testing, and deploying:
  - Build and run unit tests for the backend.
  - Build and deploy the Docker images.
  - Automate build processes for the React app and package the Electron desktop app if applicable.
- Create a `/deploy` folder if you need to store deployment scripts or Kubernetes manifests for further scalability.

## Integration Timeline

1. **Initial Web App (MVP):**  
   - Complete backend API endpoints and React frontend.
   - Integrate YAML configuration loader and volcano processor functions.
   - Dockerize and set up a CI/CD pipeline.
   
2. **Desktop App:**  
   - Wrap the React web app with Electron/Tauri.
   - Test on Windows/macOS/Linux.
   
3. **Mobile App:**  
   - Enhance the React app as a PWA or build a separate React Native project.
   
4. **Future Scalability:**  
   - Extend the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Fine-tune Docker/Kubernetes configurations for production.
   - Monitor performance and adjust resource allocations as usage grows.

## Summary

This plan ensures that BenchMate will be delivered across multiple platforms, providing a unified user experience regardless of the device or delivery method. The modular folder structure we’ve set up (with separate backend, frontend, and additional directories for desktop/mobile) supports scalable development and deployment.

Implement each phase incrementally:
- **Start with the Web App MVP,** ensuring API endpoints and the React frontend work together seamlessly.
- **Then proceed to desktop packaging** and **mobile enhancements,** using Docker and CI/CD to maintain consistent deployment practices.

This roadmap will guide our future development efforts and ensure that we maintain full functionality while expanding our platform's capabilities.
